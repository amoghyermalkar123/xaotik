[*] write a basic implementation of concurrent request model.
[] write a statistics module
    [] write response metrics:
        [] consider response time as total of server response time + latency
        [] additionally provide trace metrics so that users can segregate between actual
                server response time and other latency metrics

[] finally a(some) reporting mechanism(s)
[] wrap around a CLI

bugs :
[] transaction rate should always be floating point
